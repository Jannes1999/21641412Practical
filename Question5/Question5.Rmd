# Overview

In this report we look at some of the trends regarding the profitability of apps in different categories. In order to develop a new app it is important to take into account what categories of apps could potentially realize the most profit.

### Profitability of paid apps

While many apps are free of charge there are some that requires payment. In order to see whether this work we look at the  profitability of different categories of apps

```{r warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Profitability of paid apps\\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}

p <- profitability(alpha = 0.7)
p

```
It seems clear that for paid apps there are a few that immediately stand out. Family, Finance, Lifestyle and medical categories are the only ones that garners enough profit to be considered profitable and hence worth it to change the type from free to paid.
